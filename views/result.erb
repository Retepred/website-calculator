<h3><p>The following symbols can be used in this calculator: + - / * for basic calculations. You can use ** to calculate the first number to the power of the second number. Filling in the first number adding âˆš (by pressing alt+v) to the operator and leaving the second number clear will give you the square root.</h3>
<h3>Please understand I'm writing these instructions because I have absolutely no faith in your ability to work these simple things out for yourself...</h3>
